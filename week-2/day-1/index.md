## Daily JS

Arrays and Objects (all ES6 like)

```js
var x = 2;
var y = 3;
var z = 'hello';
var a = 'world';
var b = '2';
var c = `${a} foo ${b}`;
var d = `foo`;
var e = `${x} + ${y} = ${x + y}`;
var f = x + ' + ' + y + ' = ' + (x + y);

console.log(x + y); //
console.log(z + a); //
console.log(z + ' ' + a); //
console.log(c); //
console.log(d); //
console.log(e); //
console.log(x + z); //
console.log(x + b); //
console.log(x + Math.parseInt(b)); //
```
